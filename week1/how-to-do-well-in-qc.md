# How to Do Well in QC Sessions

Performing well in technical interviews, including QC, requires confidently answering both high-level conceptual questions on specific technologies as well as low-level details about how you’ve worked with them.

For example, as a developer you’ve most likely worked with git before. A common interview question to test your proficiency might be “Tell me about your experience working with git”. How would you answer this? Take a minute to think about it and then consider the sample responses below. Which answer would impress you more as an interviewer? Which one demonstrates an understanding and proficiency with the tool better?

### Response 1
*“Well, **uh**, for git **uh** I think I’ve used it on a few projects for pushing code… it’s really **helpful, pretty easy** to work with, it lets me **keep track** of **stuff going on** in the project and **work with other** people well.”*

### Response 2
*“So I’ve used git for almost all of my projects. It’s a really useful **distributed version control system** for managing **source code** - I’ve used it **on the command line to add, commit, and push** code to an **online repository**, usually **GitHub**, as well as switch between different **feature branches** that my team members and I work on. I like it because it **smooths the process of collaborating** on the same codebase and **merging or integrating changes**.”*

Note a few problems in the first response: the use of filler words (“ummm”, “ahh”) - you should remove these as much as possible. Don’t lower your voice and trail off at the end of sentences, it implies uncertainty. Also note the vague words that are **bolded** - it doesn’t answer **how** git is helpful, how it is easy to work with, or how it lets you keep track of “stuff” (whatever that is). Finally, the only technical word mentioned is “pushing” code.

In contrast, the second answer is well-structured and smooth, and it drops in several technical keywords that demonstrates knowledge in the domain - it explains **what** (“distributed version control”), **how** (“add, commit, push code”), and **why** (“smoothing the process of collaborating”). Putting these together, it **sounds like the person giving the second answer has worked in-depth with git**.
