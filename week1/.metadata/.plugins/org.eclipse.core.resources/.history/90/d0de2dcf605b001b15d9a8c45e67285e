	 * The GradingCalc does the following: 
	 * ** extra first prompt for the total score ---
	 * 1. It prompts the user to enter score of a student's quiz 
	 * 
	 * 2. Upon entering the score, the application will calculate the letter grade that the 
	 * student has received
	 * 
	 * 75/100 --> " The student receives a C (75%)"
	 * 
	 * A 90 -100
	 * B 80 -89
	 * C 70-79
	 * D 60-69
	 * F 0-59
	 * 
	 * Advanced Challenge: -->
	 * 	 create a program that asks for a total score (for example, a quiz might be scored out
	 * of 20, not 100 
	 * */
